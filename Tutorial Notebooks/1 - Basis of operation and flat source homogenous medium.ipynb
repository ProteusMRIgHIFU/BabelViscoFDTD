    "The simulation is executed with the function `StaggeredFDTD_3D_with_relaxation`. However, if passing the parameter `CheckOnlyParams=True` a quick verifcation of the simulation conditions is executed, especially regarding the temporal step that can be used to verify that stability conditions are met. Also, this option helps to identify potential mistakes in much more complex domains (such as transmission through bone material) in the definition of density, speeds of sound, etc. The viscoelastic simulation will transform the definition of the acoustic domain into elastic conditions as Lamé parameters ($\\mu$, $\\lambda$). For example, the Poison ratio of every voxel must be between -1.0 and 0.5. Any value ourside that range would suggest that a mistake in the material definition took place. Attenuation coefficients are transformed to $Q$-factor coefficients that use memory-type matrices to model attenuation losses. Consult the `PropagationModel.py` file for details."

In most cases, the internal calculations of these parameters will provide the best possible performance. However, in certain domain size conditions, manual adjustments can indeed improve the performance. Please consult guidelines of each backend (CUDA, OpenCL and Metal) on how to calculate this correctly, otherwise there is a risk of specifying a too large or too short grid and thread size dimensions. For example, for both CUDA and Metal, the multiplication of `ManualGroupSize` and `ManualLocalSize` must be equal or larger than [N1,N2,N3] to ensure all the domain is covered; for example for a domain of size [231,220,450], `ManualGroupSize=[60,60,115]` with `ManualLocalSize=[4,4,4]` will ensure covering the domain size. For `OpenCL` each entry in `ManualGroupSize` must be equal or larger than [N1,N2,N3] and each entry must be a multiple of its corresponding entry in `ManualLocalSize`; for example for a domain of size [231,220,450], `ManualGroupSize=[240,240,460]` with `ManualLocalSize=[4,4,4]`. Be sure of specifying these parameters as an np.array of type np.int32, such as `ManualLocalSize=np.array([4,4,4]).astype(np.int32)`. \n"
